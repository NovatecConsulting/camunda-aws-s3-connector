# AWS S3 Connector

This repository contains a Camunda Outbound Connector to easily interact with files in AWS S3 buckets ü™£:

- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload a generated file to an AWS S3 bucket
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download a file from an AWS S3 bucket
- ‚ùé Delete a file from an AWS S3 bucket
- üìÅ Files are saved in the local filesystem to allow interaction between activities

NOTE: This connector will _not_ provide any infrastructur related functionalty like creating or deleting buckets. There are better tools for that...

## Repository Content

* **[AWS S3 Connector Springboot Runtime](connector-aws-s3-standalone/README.md)** to run as a standalone connector 
without any additional worker logic

* **[Process example](connector-aws-s3-example/README.md)** on how to download/generate content and upload/delete it with the connector.

* **[Process File API](connector-file-api/README.md)** to streamline file handling between job workers and the connector.
