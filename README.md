# AWS S3 Connector

This repository contains a Camunda Outbound Connector to easily interact with files in AWS S3 buckets ü™£:

- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload a generated file to an AWS S3 bucket
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download a file from an AWS S3 bucket
- ‚ùé Delete a file from an AWS S3 bucket
- üìÅ Files are saved in the local filesystem to allow interaction between activities

NOTE: This connector will _not_ provide any infrastructur related functionalty like creating or deleting buckets. There are better tools for that...
